Expositio de Nigromans
======
I'm a Graduate from [Psijjj Order](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Psijic_Order). My research interest includes necromancy, old ways, computational alchemy and conjuration.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Emp. Varen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varen_Aquilarios) of [the Empire of Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire_of_Cyrodiil_(Interregnum)). I was tutored by [Prof. Iachesis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Iachesis) from Lab of Ritual Incantation.

You can find my autobiography here: [Return of Wyrm](../assets/return_of_wyrm.pdf), written in an Akaviri language.
